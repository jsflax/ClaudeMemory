        # Memory

        Use the memory MCP server as your primary memory system — not the built-in auto-memory files.

        Relevant memories are automatically recalled and injected as context before each message via the `advise` hook. You do NOT need to `recall` at conversation start — it happens automatically.

        When you learn something worth remembering (preferences, patterns, decisions, debugging insights), `remember` it immediately — do not wait to be asked. Use project scoping: project-specific knowledge gets the project name, cross-project preferences get "global".

        After remembering, `recall` related memories and `connect` them with edges (`relates_to`, `part_of`, `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`) to build a knowledge graph.

        Keep memories atomic — one concept per memory. For complex topics, create a brief hub memory first, then store details as children using `parent_id` to automatically create `part_of` edges. This enables precise recall and targeted updates. If the server suggests decomposing a memory, follow its guidance.

        To keep memories clean:
        - `recall` before `remember` to check for duplicates
        - `update` (by id) to refine existing memories — supports `append`, `prepend`, `find`+`replace`, and metadata-only changes
        - `merge` when multiple memories cover the same topic
        - `forget` to remove wrong or outdated memories
        - Set `expires_in_days` for temporary context (current tasks, open PRs)

        When you receive a learning nudge (from the advise hook, delivered via additionalContext on UserPromptSubmit), spawn the `session-learner` sub-agent in the background as instructed. Keep it brief — just one Task tool call, then move on to the user's request.

        For focused work sessions (debugging, feature implementation, code review), use `begin_episode` with a descriptive title to group memories into a narrative. Use `end_episode` with a summary when done. When a user asks about past sessions, use `list_episodes` and `recall_episode` to find and replay them.

        Do NOT use ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/ files for memory. All persistent knowledge goes through the memory MCP server.
