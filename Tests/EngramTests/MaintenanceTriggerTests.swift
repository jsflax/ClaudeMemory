// MARK: - Maintenance trigger: audit watermark semantics
//
// The advise hook decides whether to spawn the memory-maintenance subprocess
// by counting audit rows. It used to count `tableName == "Memory" AND
// timestamp > lastRun`, which on a 3.96M-row audit log takes 3.8s warm — on
// every prompt once past the cooldown, unbudgeted, inside the hook's window.
// It now counts above a PRIMARY KEY watermark recorded at the last spawn,
// which the index can answer without visiting the table (0.05s on the same
// database).
//
// `Advise.spawnMaintenanceIfNeeded` lives in an executable target, so these
// tests pin the two Lattice query primitives it is built on — a silent change
// in either would change the spawn cadence with no other symptom.
