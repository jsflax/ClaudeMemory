    Example(text: "The maintenance agent keeps failing to write memories. I've seen this across 11 consecutive runs. Regular sessions write fine though — I created 30 new memories today. The pattern seems to be that high query volume during maintenance exhausts some resource. Can you look at the MCP connection handling?", label: "recall"),
