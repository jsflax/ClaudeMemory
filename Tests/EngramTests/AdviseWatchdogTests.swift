// H1.6 (Aug 2026 incident): the advise hook must NEVER ride to the harness's
// silent 60s kill. When the memory database is wedged — a C++ frame stuck in
// an uninterruptible lock wait, past every in-process budget — the
// unconditional watchdog thread emits whatever context accumulated, plus a
// one-line degradation notice, and exits 0 at budget+2s.
//
// These are CHILD-PROCESS tests: they spawn the real hook binary (the
// EngramHooks executable `swift test` builds alongside the test bundle), so
// they exercise the actual process-exit contract, not a simulation of it.
// RED-FIRST: with the wedge seam engaged and the watchdog not armed, the
// child hangs and `watchdog_endsAWedgedHook` fails by kill-timeout.
